World Viewer provides an alternative way of viewing Dwarf Fortress world information (Similar to [Legends Viewer by Parker147](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=72702.0), created by parsing information supplied by the export option in legends mode.  [Here are some screenshots of World Viewer in action](http://imgur.com/a/sX2Cb#0).

[Most recent release can be downloaded on DFFD](http://dffd.wimbli.com/file.php?id=7851) - Includes 32 bit and 64 bit versions, and source.

* **Presents information exported from worldgen** - World Gen Parameters, Civilizations, Gods, Leaders, Races, Sites, Structures, Regions, Undeground Regions, Artifacts, World Constructions, Entities, Entity Populations, Historical Figures, Historical Events, Historical Event Collections, Historical Eras.  Including information not directly available in Legends mode:
*   * **Historical Figure family trees**!
*   * Battle and War summary information
*   * Dynasty details
* **Simple navigation** - Efficient navigation between different objects and all their relationships to each-other, including the ability to trace backwards and forwards after navigating through connections.
* **Support for huge XML Files** - Fully parsed up to 4.7GB XML from legends export in 64 bit version.
* **Full export to sqlite** - To allow more simplified analysis by any other tools.  sqlite database is <20% the size of the XML and encapsulates maps and history/site file data as well.
* **World Map** - Shows world map overlaid with interesting information including sites, and civilizations.  Allows map selection to view with any of the detailed maps exported from legends mode.
* **World Timeline** - Civ IV-like timeline of world events, filterable by importance.  Replay the development and build up of the world and the conflicts of it's participants, while the interesting bits are highlighted on a map.
* **Mod support** - Designed to be as mod compatible as possible, tested across at least a dozen popular mods.
* **Open Source**! - And usefully commented! To ensure it continues to be useful even if I'm unable to continue to support it.
* **Dynamic filtering** - Allows you to easily configure what you view, so if you want to see all the still living civilization leaders which have killed >15 things but less than 100 and listed as male, you can do that!
